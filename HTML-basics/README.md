Hello,

My name is Mauricio Cantillo,

This is the final project for the HTML section of the pre-course
needed to apply properly to Microverse.

As I love technology, and having being raised by a software engineer
I want to get into coding and I'm willing to do anything necessary
to accomplish that.

This section has been truly helpful, as me, a total newbie without
any coding language, was able to understand all the basics of HTML
in less than a week.

This is the website where I'm going to show everyone that I can do
this.

I will write about how it went after I finish it.
